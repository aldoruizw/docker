# 🐳 Portainer Stacks for Raspberry Pi

This repository contains my personal **Portainer stacks** managed with Docker on my Raspberry Pi setup. Each stack is defined as a single `docker-compose` file for easy deployment and maintenance.

## 🚀 Overview

These stacks include self-hosted services, databases, and utilities optimized for ARM architecture (Raspberry Pi 4/5). Managed via **Portainer** for simplicity and centralized control.
