# 🐳 Docker Stacks for Raspberry Pi

This repository contains my personal **Docker Compose stacks** running on my Raspberry Pi setup. Each stack is defined in its own file for easy management, deployment, and versioning.

---

## 🚀 Overview

These stacks include self-hosted services, development tools, and utilities optimized for ARM architecture (Raspberry Pi 4/5). The goal is to keep everything **lightweight, reproducible, and well documented**.
